--- A fast and light webapp to create, export and edit simple organization charts ---

I think it's been my idea, I haven't seen it anywhere else. I'm a 15 yrs old Argentinian with nearly no knowledge about programming, so I've made everything so far with Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash, so shoutout Google lol.

It's purpouse is to be fully controlable with the keyboard, and to be fast to load, upload, download anything you should do to be fast, light and simple.

If anyoune ever PR's here, please specify on plain text what have you done, remember i got nearly no knowledge about programming, as I stablished a couple lines before

##Current version preview 
###(many features are only experiencable if you use it, I don't think we'll have many visual updates)
